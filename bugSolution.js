The corrected code, as shown in the bug report, explicitly checks for the document's existence using `snapshot.exists()` before accessing its data.  This prevents errors and ensures the application handles missing documents gracefully.

```javascript
const snapshot = await getDoc(docRef);
if (snapshot.exists()) {
  const city = snapshot.data().city;
  console.log(city);
} else {
  console.log('Document does not exist!');
}
```
This improved version handles the case of a nonexistent document, preventing unexpected crashes.
